# dns_catalog_helper
A set of descripton and helper ps scripts to get an MS DNS Server as hidden master with catalog zone to bind slaves working.

[The catalog feature of bind](https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-01401) is realy cool to 
configure which zones the slaves must serve without even touching the slaves at all.
